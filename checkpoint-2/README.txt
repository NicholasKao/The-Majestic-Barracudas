Questions/Visualizations to create:
1) Scatterplot with key characteristics of units vs. number of complaints against the unit
2) Scatterplot with key characteristics of units vs. number of TRRs
3) Scatterplot with information about how long certain partners have worked together (how many shifts have they shared) vs. how many complaints/TRRâ€™s they received while working together. --> Decided it would be better for interactive visualization checkpoint.

Note: I am looking to alter my third question as it depends on dynamically looking at data changes on a very granular level, which is not supported efficiently through SQL programming. I am meeting with the prof tomorrow to discuss my project further.

Instructions:

To find the visualizations for the first question, open the workbook, "Checkpoint2-part1" and view the dashboard on the tab "UnitCompositionAndAllegations." From there, each scatterplot is clearly titled to describe what is being displayed.

To find the visualizations for the second question, open the workbook, "Checkpoint2-part2" and view the dashboard on the tab "UnitCompositionAndTRRs." From there, each scatterplot is clearly titled to describe what is being displayed.

The visualizations for the third question will be a part of the interaction visualization checkpoint.
